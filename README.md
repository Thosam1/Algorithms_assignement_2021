# Algorithms_assignement_2021

This is a programming assigment / competition where I ended up 112th (WinterCloud on Codeforces)

link to the contest : https://codeforces.com/group/xCrFU3cJ98/contest/356183

I spent more than a week trying to optimize for the question B.

Answer file for question :
A : main.java
B : aroundTheWorld_lessMemory_Last_Version69_v2.java
c: ProblemC.java


If you are also a second Year taking CS-250 at EPFL then you can try to solve those alone gl !

(I also have some test cases that I have uploaded)











Spoiler hint for question B: 
You can add one extra city where all airports are linked to it.
